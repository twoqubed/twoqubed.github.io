# Dan-Dan Noodles

Serves: 4-6

## Ingredients

* 3 skinless/boneless chicken breasts, cooked and minced (rotisserie works too)
* 8 oz dried fettuccine or linguine noodles
* 2 tbsp Asian sesame oil (brown and highly aromatic, found in Asian aisles)
* 2 tbsp cooking oil
* 4 cloves minced garlic
* 3/4 cup regular soy sauce
* 1 1/2 cup good chicken broth
* 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 tsp Sriracha (Asian hot sauce, found in Asian aisles)
* 6 tsp cornstarch, dissolved in 1⁄2 cup chicken broth
* 1 cucumber, peeled and julienned
* 1/2 cup chopped peanuts or cashews for topping
* Chopped green onions for garnish

## Directions

1. Set aside cooked/minced chicken.
2. In a large heavy pot, cook noodles in salted water until al dente (don't over­cook) according to package. Drain and toss with Asian sesame oil to prevent sticking and for flavor infusion. Set aside.
3. In a saucepan, heat cooking oil over medium heat. Add garlic and stir until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add soy sauce, chicken broth, brown sugar, and Sriracha. Stir well. Add cornstarch dissolved in broth. Stir constantly while simmering, until sauce thickens.
4. Once sauce has thickened, add the minced/cooked chicken and simmer in the sauce for about 5 minutes.
5. If noodles have cooled too much, warm it up in microwave. Toss noodles with desired amount of chicken/sauce mixture, or just toss it all in! Toss in julienned cucumber to combine.
6. Divide onto serving plates or bowls. Garnish with green onions and nuts, if desired.
